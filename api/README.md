1.0 Introduction
1.1 Motivation:
The rising costs of transportation, traffic congestion, and environmental concerns have made traditional commuting methods increasingly unsustainable. As urban populations grow, there is a growing need for affordable, efficient, and eco-friendly transportation options. Ride-sharing offers a practical solution by enabling individuals to share car journeys, reducing both travel expenses and carbon emissions. The motivation behind this research is to explore how technology-driven ride-sharing platforms can optimize travel efficiency, promote sustainability, and foster a sense of community among commuters.
1.2 Background:
Ride-sharing services have gained popularity worldwide, with platforms like Uber, Lyft, and BlaBlaCar leading the market. These platforms leverage GPS technology, data analytics, and mobile connectivity to connect drivers with passengers traveling along similar routes. However, despite their success, existing systems face challenges related to route optimization, user safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact. Many current solutions focus primarily on urban areas, leaving suburban and rural commuters underserved. Additionally, concerns regarding privacy, trust, and ride availability persist, highlighting the need for more secure and community-driven platforms.
Technological advancements in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and real-time data processing present new opportunities to address these challenges. By developing an innovative ride-sharing system that integrates advanced route-matching algorithms, secure user authentication, and digital payment solutions, this research aims to create a platform that enhances commuting experiences while contributing to broader environmental and social goals.
1.3 Context: 
This research is conducted within the context of sustainable transportation, smart cities, and digital transformation. With governments and organizations increasingly prioritizing sustainability, the transportation sector is undergoing a significant shift toward eco-friendly solutions. Ride-sharing aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon footprints and alleviate urban congestion, making it a key component of future mobility systems. The study will also explore the role of cloud-based platforms in enabling scalable, real-time ride-sharing services that can adapt to evolving commuter needs.
‚ÄÉ

1.4 Research Problem:
Despite the benefits of ride-sharing, existing platforms often fall short in terms of efficiency, user experience, and environmental impact. Key challenges include inefficient route matching, limited availability in non-urban areas, and concerns about passenger safety and data privacy. Additionally, the high costs associated with some services can deter potential users. The research problem is to design a ride-sharing system that addresses these limitations by optimizing ride utilization, ensuring secure and transparent transactions, and promoting environmentally friendly commuting practices. This study seeks to answer the question:
"How can a technology-driven ride-sharing system improve commuting efficiency, reduce transportation costs, and promote environmental sustainability while ensuring user safety and trust?"
 
2.0 Aims & Objectives
2.1 Suitability
the proposed project, RideShare ‚Äì A Community-Centric Ride-Sharing System, is highly suitable for the MSc Software Engineering programme as it demonstrates both technical depth and practical relevance. It integrates modern technologies such as Python with FastAPI, MongoDB for geospatial querying, Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, and Apache Kafka for real-time messaging‚Äîeach selected to align with best practices in full-stack, scalable systems engineering.
The project moves beyond basic development by incorporating applied research through a real-world pilot study, evaluating metrics like ride-match efficiency, user trust, and CO‚ÇÇ savings. This addresses critical learning outcomes such as ethical system design, analytical thinking, and rigorous performance evaluation. Additionally, the system tackles real societal challenges‚Äîurban congestion, environmental sustainability, and digital trust‚Äîmaking it both academically rich and socially impactful.
The scope and timeline are carefully tailored to a 4‚Äì6 week development window, with a focused MVP, milestone-based work plan, and use of free-tier cloud and mapping services. Altogether, RideShare is a technically sound, research-informed, and realistically scoped project that meets the expectations of an MSc-level dissertation in Software Engineering.
Furthermore, the project reflects a strong alignment with core MSc Software Engineering competencies, including system architecture, agile development, real-time data handling, and ethical technology implementation. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate mastery in designing and deploying a distributed, user-facing application that incorporates both functional and non-functional requirements. With its emphasis on measurable outcomes, user-centric design, and sustainable impact, RideShare offers a holistic platform to showcase both technical proficiency and applied research within a compressed but achievable timeline.

‚ÄÉ
2.2 SMARTness of the Objectives
The objectives set for the RideShare project are fully aligned with the SMART framework‚ÄîSpecific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound‚Äîas defined by ProjectSmart. Each objective is designed not only to guide implementation but also to meet academic expectations for precision, feasibility, and evaluation.
Specific (S):
Every objective clearly outlines the intended task and expected outcome. For example, "Design and implement a ride-matching algorithm using OSRM and Mapbox Directions API" explicitly defines what will be built and which technologies will be used. Similarly, the aim to ‚Äúdevelop a Flutter-based passenger interface‚Äù outlines a defined user-facing component with a clear platform and scope.
Measurable (M):
Progress and success are tracked through measurable outputs: API availability (e.g., visible in Swagger UI), match rates (e.g., ‚â• 60% successful matches in test cases), response times, user satisfaction (Likert-scale surveys), and environmental impact (CO‚ÇÇ saved using DEFRA factors). These quantifiable indicators ensure that the project‚Äôs success is based on tangible, data-driven results rather than subjective assessments.
Attainable (A):
Objectives are carefully scoped to match my technical background and the available development timeframe (4‚Äì6 weeks). Technologies like Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, and Flutter are within my current skill set or supported with quick start learning curves. The MVP is streamlined by excluding complex features like payment processing and multi-hop routing, making each task realistically achievable with the given resources.
Relevant (R):
Each objective directly supports the core aim of the project: to deliver a working, user-tested ride-sharing system that addresses real-world challenges such as route optimisation, trust, and urban sustainability. Features like driver verification, geo-matching, and real-time updates serve the system‚Äôs value proposition and are aligned with both technical goals and stakeholder needs.
Time-bound (T):
All objectives are explicitly scheduled within a detailed 6-week Gantt chart, with week-level deadlines for backend/API completion, UI integration, testing, evaluation, and final write-up. This allows for milestone-based tracking and effective risk management, ensuring that progress can be monitored and adjustments made as needed.

Summary
The RideShare project‚Äôs objectives are SMART in such a way that they ensure that every task is focused, assessable, and achievable within the project‚Äôs constraints, while still delivering a meaningful, research-informed, and technically robust outcome.

‚ÄÉ
3.0 Initial Literature Review
3.1 Route Matching Algorithms and Optimisation
At the heart of any ride-sharing system is a matching mechanism that connects passengers with drivers travelling along compatible routes. Traditional approaches such as the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants form the theoretical basis for these systems. Dantzig and Ramser (1959) first formalised the VRP, and it has since evolved to include dynamic and time-dependent variants suitable for real-time ride-matching (Psaraftis et al., 2016). Contemporary implementations use heuristics and spatial indexing to enable real-time operation (Agatz et al., 2012). However, existing systems often treat the algorithm as a ‚Äúblack box,‚Äù leaving users unaware of why certain matches are made. RideShare addresses this gap by making the detour cost visible to users, adding transparency to the decision-making process.
3.2 User Trust, Safety, and Adoption Barriers
Trust remains a major barrier to ride-sharing adoption. Studies by B√∂sch et al. (2018) and Dias et al. (2017) show that concerns over driver vetting, personal safety, and accountability limit participation, especially among women and first-time users. These findings support industry trends where safety features such as real-time tracking, panic buttons, and verified identities have become standard. RideShare integrates these elements at the MVP level, applying multi-factor user authentication and a built-in safety alert protocol. This aligns with best practices recommended in privacy-preserving mobility systems (Shaheen & Cohen, 2018).
3.3 Environmental and Economic Impact
Several studies confirm the environmental benefits of shared mobility. According to a European Commission white paper (2017), carpooling can reduce traffic volume and emissions by up to 20% when widely adopted. More recently, Arslan et al. (2019) found that dynamic ride-sharing systems in urban areas reduced CO‚ÇÇ emissions and travel costs significantly, depending on occupancy and route efficiency. Although most findings are simulation-based, they provide strong indicators of impact potential. RideShare builds on this by evaluating real-world pilot data using DEFRA (2024) carbon reporting conversion factors.
3.4 Technology Stack Reviews
Modern ride-sharing applications leverage distributed, containerised architectures for scalability. Uber‚Äôs architecture (Garg et al., 2019) is a benchmark example, using microservices, cloud-native infrastructure, and real-time analytics. For this project, technologies like FastAPI, MongoDB (with 2dsphere indexing), Docker, and Kafka have been selected due to their compatibility with open-source development, academic licensing, and ease of integration. These tools also reflect current industry practice and are covered extensively in open developer documentation and usage case studies (Tiangolo, 2024; MongoDB, 2024).
3.5 Adoption Challenges in Suburban Areas
Most ride-sharing systems are designed with urban densities in mind. Shaheen & Chan (2016) highlight that suburban regions often suffer from limited ride availability, weaker demand clustering, and low trust among users. Cultural and psychological barriers such as stigma or a preference for private travel also reduce uptake in semi-urban settings. RideShare addresses these limitations through optional community-based filtering and simplified matching logic that reduces wait times and builds trust within local user pools.

3.6 Critical Synthesis & Gaps Addressed
The reviewed literature confirms that while ride-sharing can promote environmental sustainability, reduce travel costs, and increase vehicle utilisation, persistent challenges remain in transparency, inclusivity, and suburban adoption. RideShare directly responds to these gaps through:
‚Ä¢	A transparent route-matching interface that displays detour and proximity data.
‚Ä¢	A community-centric design tailored for smaller or lower-density regions.
‚Ä¢	Integration of core safety features at the MVP level, with compliance to ethical and legal norms.
By combining these elements with a user-tested pilot and real-time data evaluation, the project moves beyond replication to offer meaningful, research-led innovation.
‚ÄÉ
4.0 Ethics and Legal Relevance & Progress 
The RideShare project involves the collection and processing of real-time location data, hashed user identities, and survey responses for system evaluation. Given the nature of this data and its association with identifiable individuals, the project must fully comply with the UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and the latest guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
All ethics risks have been reviewed according to the Accountability Principle (Art. 5(2), UK GDPR) and aligned with privacy-by-design (Art. 25), ensuring compliance is embedded throughout the system's architecture and pilot research protocol.
4.1 Key Ethics and Legal Compliance Measures

Area	Risk	Response
Data Minimisation & Lawfulness (Art. 5, 6)	Over-collection of personal data	Only essential data is collected (pickup/drop-off coordinates, hashed user IDs). Lawful basis is performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b)) for app use and informed consent (Art. 6(1)(a)) for pilot research participation (ICO, 2023a).
Consent Transparency (Art. 7)	Lack of clear explanation of rights	A GDPR-compliant Privacy Notice will be displayed in-app and at the start of all research participation, fulfilling ICO guidance on "clear, plain language" (ICO, 2023a).
User Rights (Art. 15‚Äì22)	Inability to exercise access/erasure	Procedures are documented to handle Subject Access Requests (SARs), withdrawal of consent, and deletion requests within 30 days, in line with ICO timelines.
Children‚Äôs Data (Art. 8)	Underage user sign-up	Age-restricted sign-up prevents use by anyone under 16. Age is validated by self-declaration with an optional secondary check (e.g. year of birth).
Data Security (Art. 32)	Unauthorised access or data loss	Enforced TLS encryption (HTTPS), hashed credentials (bcrypt), and token-based authentication (JWT). The system will apply OWASP ASVS Level 1 as a baseline.
International Transfers (Art. 44‚Äì49)	Non-compliant data export	All data is stored in UK-based AWS and MongoDB Atlas regions. No transfers outside the UK/EEA are allowed.

4.2 Additional Risk Controls
‚Ä¢	Pilot participants will sign e-consent forms stored securely in encrypted S3 buckets.
‚Ä¢	Data retention is limited to 90 days (raw logs); evaluation data will be pseudonymised before analysis.
‚Ä¢	If ethical approval is delayed, the pilot will shift to GPS replay simulation using synthetic users.

4.3 Summary
The RideShare project is designed to respect user autonomy, minimise data risks, and align fully with UK GDPR and university research ethics expectations. Consent, data minimisation, secure processing, and withdrawal mechanisms are all built into the project‚Äôs technical and research workflows. 
‚ÄÉ
